The "Data" folder contains subfolders for each of the 3 experiments in this study (Exp 1A, Exp 1B, Exp 2) with the raw data as .txt files from each participant.

The "Code" folder contains code for processing the raw data from mouse-tracking to generate the dependent measures (batchTrajectoryAnalysis.R files), and code for obtaining the descriptives and running the linear mixed effects models reported in the paper (the Code_LMERs.R files).
